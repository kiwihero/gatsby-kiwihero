## Distortion
To start off we create a simple distortion effect that will play in the beginning. 

```
const dist = new Tone.Distortion(0.8).toDestination();
const fm = new Tone.FMSynth().connect(dist);
fm.triggerAttackRelease("G1", "8n");
```

## FeedbackDelay

FeedbackDelay is a DelayNode in which part of output signal is fed back into the delay. 

```
const feedbackDelay = new Tone.FeedbackDelay("8n", 0.5).toDestination();
const tom = new Tone.MembraneSynth({
	octaves: 4,
	pitchDecay: 0.1
}).connect(feedbackDelay);
tom.triggerAttackRelease("A3", "32n");
```


## PingPongDelay 
Just as the name suggests it  sounds like a ping pong. PingPongDelay is feedback delay effect where the effect is echoed in one channel and is play next in the opposite channel. This is a PingPongDelay effect. 

```
const pingPong = new Tone.PingPongDelay("4n", 0.2).toDestination();
const drum = new Tone.MembraneSynth().connect(pingPong);
drum.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "32n");
```
Note that each delay is routed to a different channel. Effects can also be looped. 

```
const pingPong = new Tone.PingPongDelay("4n", 0.2).toDestination();
const drum = new Tone.MembraneSynth().connect(pingPong);

const loop = new Tone.Loop(time => {
	drum.triggerAttackRelease("C4", "32n");
}, "2n").start(0);
```
