## Synths
As always we create the synth. This time we are using 3 synths for triple the fun. As a side note, toMaster is deprecated and  toDestination connects the output to the context's destination node.

```
const synthA = new Tone.PolySynth().toDestination();
const synthB = new Tone.FMSynth().toDestination();
const synthC = new Tone.AMSynth().toDestination();
```
## Loops and Callbacks 
To create loops and callbacks at a specfic interval use Tone.Loop. Below we have three loops for each of the synths above.  

```
//play a note every sixteenth-note
const loopA = new Tone.Loop(time => {
	synthA.triggerAttackRelease("C2", "8n", time);
}, "16n").start(0);

//play another note every off quarter-note, starting it "2n"
const loopB = new Tone.Loop(time => {
	synthB.triggerAttackRelease("D2", "8n", time);
}, "4n").start("2n");

//play another note every off half-note,by starting it "2n"
const loopC = new Tone.Loop(time => {
	synthC.triggerAttackRelease("E2", "8n", time);
}, "2n").start("2n");
 ```
Don't forget to start the sound.
 
```
Tone.Transport.start()
``` 
## Bpm 
For the bpm , we are ramping it up to 135 over 10 seconds.

```
Tone.Transport.bpm.rampTo(135, 10);
```

The end result is that the audio plays the synths and their respective loops. Also its a quick way to create a bassline.
